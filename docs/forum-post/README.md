# Forum Post HTML

It is difficult to produce clean and deliberate forum posts with the editor on MAM (tinyMCE).

Therefore, `index.html` contains a complete HTML version of the forum post. To import it:

1. Copy the contents of `index.html` to the clipboard
2. Edit the forum post on MAM
3. Under the "View" menu, select "Source code"
4. Replace all content with the clipboard contents
5. Preview and submit.
