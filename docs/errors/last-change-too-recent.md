# "Last change too recent"

![Last Change Too Recent Error](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/t-mart/mousehole/master/docs/images/last-change-too-recent.png)

This error indicates that Mousehole has attempted to update your IP address with
MAM, but MAM has rejected the update because the last change happened too
recently.

MAM enforces a minimum time interval between IP address changes for security
reasons. 

You just have to wait it out! It takes one hour since your last update.
