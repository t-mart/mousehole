# API

Mousehole provides an API for programmatic access to its functionality.

## Authentication

Protected endpoints accept a Bearer token. Set the `MOUSEHOLE_AUTH_TOKEN`
environment variable (or its [`_FILE` variant](/README.md#docker-secrets)) and
pass it in the `Authorization` header:

```
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

Example with curl:

```sh
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer mytoken" http://localhost:5010/state
```

## State shape

`GET /state`, `PUT /cookie`, and `POST /updates` all return the same public
state object. It never contains your cookie.

Mousehole records each exchange with MAM as a **contact**; when a cookie is set,
the contact performs an IP **update** (the `ipUpdate` field below).

```jsonc
{
  "hasCookie": true, // is a MAM cookie configured?
  "hasAuth": true, // is the web UI password-protected?
  "nextContactAt": "2025-06-21T14:27:28.113-05:00[America/Chicago]", // RFC 9557
  // The most recent contact with MAM. Absent until the first check runs.
  "lastMamContact": {
    "at": "2025-06-21T14:22:28.111-05:00[America/Chicago]",
    "reached": true, // we got an HTTP response from MAM
    "ip": "123.123.123.123",
    "asn": 12345,
    "as": "MegaCorp",
    // Present only when a cookie drove an update (the dynamicSeedbox call).
    "ipUpdate": { "success": true, "msg": "No change", "httpStatus": 200 },
  },
}
```

`lastMamContact` is a tagged union on `reached`:

- **Reached, with a cookie** — has `ip`/`asn`/`as` and an `ipUpdate`
  (`httpStatus` is `200` ok, `429` throttled, `403` rejected; `msg` is MAM's
  text, for display only).
- **Reached, no cookie yet** (setup lookup) — has `ip`/`asn`/`as`, no
  `ipUpdate`.
- **Unreachable** (transport failure) — no host fields:
  ```json
  {
    "at": "…",
    "reached": false,
    "error": {
      "type": "timeout-error",
      "message": "Request to … timed out after 10s. Is the network up?"
    }
  }
  ```

## `GET /state`

Requires Auth?: Yes

A pure read of the current state — it does **not** contact MAM, so it always
responds quickly and can't fail on a network blip. Returns the
[state shape](#state-shape).

## `PUT /cookie`

Requires Auth?: Yes

Set the MAM session cookie. This stores the credential **and** immediately
contacts MAM with it, so the response reflects whether the cookie works (e.g. a
`403` rejection shows up right away). Returns the [state shape](#state-shape).

Example request body:

```json
{ "value": "<your-mam_id-cookie-value>" }
```

`value` must be a non-empty string; an empty value is rejected with a `400`.

## `POST /updates`

Requires Auth?: Yes

Run an update now: contact MAM and persist the result. Takes no body. Returns
the [state shape](#state-shape).

## `GET /health`

Requires Auth?: No

Answers **`200` whenever the server is up and serving**. The `ok`/`reason` body
reports the MAM sync state for humans and monitors, but **never** changes the
status code. So the container stays healthy even when your IP needs re-syncing —
that's a job for you on the dashboard, not a reason to restart the container or
pull it from rotation.

```jsonc
{ "sync": { "ok": true,  "reason": "ok" }}       // synced
{ "sync": { "ok": false, "reason": "rejected" }} // needs attention — still HTTP 200
```

`reason` is one of: `ok`, `throttled` (429), `rejected` (403), `unreachable`,
`no-cookie` (set one up), `pending` (no check has run yet).

## `GET /events`

Requires Auth?: Yes

A
[Server-Sent Events](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events)
stream the web UI subscribes to. The events have no content; they just signal
"something has changed, re-pull `GET /state`". Used by the dashboard to update
live without polling. Not generally useful to API clients.
